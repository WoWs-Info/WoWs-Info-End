<h1>WoWs Info オリジン</h1>

This is not the official app for [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/). It is my own project and it is powered by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It supports IOS, Android and [UWP](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Origin/tree/win10). Data are from [Wargaming API](https://developers.wargaming.net), [WoWs Numbers](http://wows-numbers.com) and [Global Wiki](https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/World_of_Warships).

# Technical insights
JSON based database (NoSQL) is used to store data. WoWs Info will only update data when the game updates or every week to make sure data is always up to date. The way how I interact with data isn't ideal. I should have used Singeleton pattern to wrap global/static in a class. This way, I could prevent many code duplications. You should always plan ahead. I spent two years working this project but I would have spent 2 months designing it and save a year but I didn't.

*All of this will be changed and improved in [WoWs Info RE](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re/tree/WoWs-Info-Re), the next big update for WoWs Info.*

# プロバージョンについて
My admob account has been terminated due to some unknown reasons for almost **2 years**. Therefore, pro version is necessary to maintain WoWs Info. Without your support, it is unlikely that I will add more features and even update WoWs Info regularly.

It will be **3USD** annually and it will be available in **update 1.0.7.1**. Since the new version hasn't been completed, *it will be half price (1.49USD) for all users until WoWs Info RE update.*

# Run this project
- Setup [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) on your computer. Make sure you follow `React Native CLI Quickstart`.
- Clone WoWs Info to your computer
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Origin.git
~~~~
- Run the following commands to install package and run it on your IOS devices (but it won't work)
~~~~
cd WoWsInfo 
yarn
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
react-native run-ios
~~~~
- You will need to get a key from [here](https://developers.wargaming.net) and create a file called 'key.js' inside 'WoWsInfo/src/value' folder with this line of code. Then, you can run WoWs Info on your devices.
~~~~
export const AppKey = '<Your Key>';
~~~~

If you don't want to pay for the pro version, you can change the source code and compile yourself. **However, it is prohibited to distribute your modified app elsewhere.**
