# End-User License Agreement
Version 1.0 (May 27th, 2020)

The End-User License Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between you, the user, and Yiheng Quan, the developer, regarding your use of WoWs Info applications, including iOS and Android version.

# The Agreement
By downloading, installing, using or copying WoWs Info application, you agree to this EULA. If you do not agree to anything of this EULA, you should not download, install, use or copy the application.

# Using the application
The application is free to download and use. By downloading the application, you have been granted a license to use on all your devices. However, there is no guarantee that the application will work as expected on your specific device due to networking issues. In this case, you may contact the developer.

# Pro version
Most parts (about 90%) of the application are free to use. There are certain features that can be unlocked with in-app purchases. It is your choice to unlock those features and the developer will never force you to do that. By purchasing the pro version, you have been granted a license for one year to use all features of the application on your devices only with the account you purchased with (it can be either an Apple ID or a Google account). The price of the pro version varies in regions and it can be updated in the future. Features included can also be adjusted. 

# Updates
There might be updates including bug fixed and feature updates to the existing application but it is not compulsory. Since the application mostly uses data from third parties, I can not guarantee that the application will always work.
